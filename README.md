# jas-ventures-hack
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project, designed specifically for detecting and tracking sheep using quadrocopters. 
This project was created as part of the JAS Ventures hackathon and we are excited to share it with the judges for evaluation!

We use advanced computer vision on the base of OpenCV library to analyze aerial imagery and identify sheep in real-time.
By leveraging deep learning algorithms, we have trained our model to detect sheep with a consistantly high accuracy, considering it is only a model of what we will use in future.

In addition to detection, our project would be capable of tracking, defending and control sheeps' path by managing our drones in specific ways. 
This feature is particularly useful for farmers and landowners who need to monitor their flocks and ensure their safety, without having to worry about their health.

In this repo, you can see the code for the prototype of our website and our AI model.

We hope you find our tool to be a valuable contribution to agricultural activity in our country. 
If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us.
Thank you for considering our project for evaluation!
